Since Starlink provides their clients a public IPv6, which is globally accessible, we
leveraged on it building from scratch a custom image of OpenWRT dedicated to Raspberry
Pi. This offers a proper and reliable Modem-Router with pre-configured settings studiously
assessed for working with the Starlink Dish as plug and play.
The Android application of Pi Starlink will allow you to set up your own free VPN
all over IPv6 in a few easy steps and reach your Home Network while ensuring adequate
security you need to surf the net safely. The VPN is based on OpenVPN, which is free and
also, it works with the APIs provided by the fork project of OpenVPN for Android. Pi
Starlink is not only oriented to the normal Starlink customers but even to people who want
to host their own public server globally as our application has specific features for
managing port forwarding rules. In case you get an ethernet port extender, we’ll be able to
set up a proper DMZ, all is up to you! An IPv6 address is certainly not easy to remember
because of its length, that’s why our application points you in a good direction for you in
order to set up a free Dynamic DNS, getting a fully qualified domain name to share with
people to you want to reach your game server, or your web page! We tried to raise an
application that is far from complex, but feel free to open an issue if you encounter any
problem.
Last but not least, one of the main goals of this project is power saving,
because Pi Starlink replaced the original Starlink router, which has a higher power
consumption compared to the low cost Single Board Computer we’re working on. As a
matter of fact, most of the Starlink vanlifer users might be interested in this project as the
power is a critical point they used to facing every day when they travel, and that’s now
something very reachable. Just buy the PoE(Power over Ethernet) which powers up all
your items from 12v switching to 46v avoiding any a.c inverter.
